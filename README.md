# Introduction 
In Belgium, public services interact with each others directly.
For example, when a hospital need to know your National Identification Number, it's administration will access you town administration services.
This access is marked with a reason.

Privacy Passport is a portal on which any Belgian citizen can connect to with their e-ID in order to see all these accesses.

But this project is not only about that portal.
It also contains a hole system through which the public services should be going in order to communicate.
This central point redirects requests between public services and log these accesses in a private blockchain.

This project is a prototype that will be used to show the usability of this system.

It currently contains : 
* the Privacy Passport portal
* a mocked public service
* the central system connected to the blockchain

The blockchain genesis is stored on a VM on Azure.
